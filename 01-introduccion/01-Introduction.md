# **INTRODUCTION**

<p align="justify">
This module of the Introduction to Data Analytics on Google Cloud.

Focus on Google Cloud **data analytics workflow** and describes Google Cloud **data sources** and **storage methods**.


## **Data Analytics lifecycle**

The data analytics lifecycle provides a framework for organizing the different steps involved in data analytics. <br>

This framework can help to ensure that the necessary steps are taken, and that they are taken in the correct order.<br>

Storing, managing, and organizing your data is the foundation for data analytics on Google Cloud.<br>

Our focus will be on the tools that facilitate each step of the process

### ***Ingest*** 
Products such as **Pub/Sub**, **Dataflow**, **Dataproc**, and **Cloud Data Fusion** are used to ingest and process both real-time and batch data.

**Cloud Data Fusion** It is a fully managed, cloud-first data integration service.

This code-free, extract, transform, and load–or ETL–tool integrates data across on-premises and cloud sources.

**Pub/Sub** is for ingestion and messaging, And **Dataflow** is for analytics and processing.

After data is ingested, it needs to be processed.
### **Process** 


**Dataproc** can be used to batch process data, **Dataflow** to stream data, or **Cloud Data Fusion** to integrate data from multiple sources.

### **Store**

Google Cloud storage options include **databases**, **data lakes**, and **data warehouses.**

**Google Cloud storage products include:** Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Bigtable, Firestore, AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, and BigQuery.

**Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, and AlloyDB** for PostgreSQL are relational databases, whereas **Bigtable and Firestore** are NoSQL databases.

**BigQuery** is Google Cloud’s data warehouse solution.

### **Analyze**

BigQuery is at the core of data analytics on Google Cloud.

In addition to BigQuery, you can analyze data and visualize results by using **Looker** And **Looker Studio.**
